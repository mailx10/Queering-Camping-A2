                    Now that you’ve planned where you’re going and when, it’s time to pack!<br><br>

                    Your packing list will consist of three main categories: food, clothing, and general camping equipment. In terms of what to pack in, bins are your best friend! Not only are they convenient, but they are waterproof, animal proof, and multi-purpose (a food bin, once empty, can be used as a dish washing bin, etc). Invest in some good bins that you can store camping equipment in for years to come.

                            While planning meals, keep in mind what cooking gear you will have at your disposal. You can bring a camping stove or you can cook on the fire. Plan all meals with your group before leaving and split the task of grocery shopping. Try to think of meals that are easy to prepare and are suitable for big groups. Also try to choose meals that have an overlap of ingredients, for ease of grocery shopping.

                            Clothing preferences are highly personal. However, the one thing to remember is to bring layers to be able to adapt to weather changes. It can get quite chilly at night, even on hot summer days. If you’re camping near a body of water (especially ocean), the temperature can drastically drop overnight. I recommend bringing toques, thick winter socks, and gloves just in case!<br><br>

                            If you live in an area which has a high number of mosquitos, bring some long socks and turtlenecks to cover as much skin as possible once the sun sets.

                            Packing for camping looks different for everyone. The more you go camping, the more your packing list will be refined and work for you. I suggest starting a packing list on Google Docs or another shareable platform that you can share with the people you’re going on the trip with and adjust accordingly for each trip.<br><br>

                            <br>One of the most important items in camping are BINS! Pack everything in plastic bins that clip shut, including food. Organize your items by purpose (ex. Cooking bin, pantry bin, site gear bin, etc.) Secure the bins with locking carabiners and lock them in the car at night.<br><br>

                            Try to thrift, borrow, rent, and share items as much as possible. There’s no need to go out and buy new gear. Bring items you already own from home!

                            Keep in mind that if you’re camping on a provincial campground, there will almost always be a small store with camping essentials. If you forget something important, you can likely buy it from there, or consider asking one of your camp neighbours to borrow from them!<br><br>

                            Do not worry about overpacking! There is a lot of shame out there for overpacking- ignore it. Especially with car camping, as long as you can fit everything in your car without obstructing your view of the road, you’re fine. With camping, overpacking is always better than underpacking. As you gain experience, you start to learn what you don’t need and adjust accordingly!

                                Make sure you know how your first aid kit works before you leave. Everyone in your group should know where it is located and how it works. Medical care is not as easy to access when out camping, so a well-stocked first aid kit is essential.

                                Make sure you choose a sleeping pad that is comfortable for you. This might be a simple yoga mat, or a inflatable air mattress, or maybe even a small cot. Make sure that it fits in your tent.
