        <h2 class=heading2> 03 Setting Up </h2>
        <p class=body-copy>
        You made it to the campsite! …What now?<br><br>

        Take some time to look around before you start setting up. Situational awareness is crucial when camping. Walk around the site and take in the landscape. Are there trees that you need to use to set up a tarp? Any poison ivy to avoid? Sharp rocks that could be a hazard in the dark? Famiiarize yourself with your new temporary home.

            Finding a Good Spot & Pitching Your Tent
        </h3>
        <p class="body-copy">
            Choosing where to set up your tent is super important, since tents are not easy to move once set up.
        </p>
        <ul class=text-list>
            <li>Look for a nice level surface to pitch your tent. Make sure the area is free from big rocks and sticks and that the ground is completely dry.</li>
            <li>Look up and make sure there are no standing dead trees and branches that could fall on your tent.</li>
            <li>Lay a tarp (footprint) under your tent. This will help protect your tent from condensation coming off the ground, and keep your tent warmer at night.. Let some of the tarp stick out the front of the tent to leave a spot to leave your shoes before entering the tent.</li>
            <li>Ensure that your tent is a good distance from the firepit.</li>
            <li>Consider where the entrance and any ‘windows’ of your tent will face.</li>
            <li>Consider sun exposure and shade patterns, flow of rain, and the weather during your trip. If the weather will be colder, you’ll want the sun to immediately hit your tent in the morning. If it’s going to be warme,  you’ll want more shade, so the sun hits your tent less and later (it can get really hot and stuffy in a tent.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="heading4">
            Setting up a tarp
        </h4>
        <ul class=text-list>
            <li>The rainfly that come with the tent might not be enough if it rains a lot. If the weather calls for heavy rain, set up additional tarps (include tutorial link). This depends on the quality of your tent. If the weather forecast calls for rain, just put up some tarps right away. You don’t want to be doing it in the pouring rain!</li>
            <li>Setting up a tarp is an art. While watching tutorials can be helpful, each campsite is different, and may require some improvisation. The most important thing to remember is to slant the tarp so that the water runs AWAY from your tent. Gather some friends and treat it as a team building exercise! If there are no trees available to hang a tarp from, drape it over the top of your tent - it will be better than nothing! What’s camping without a little water?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="heading4">
            Setting up your sleeping quarters
        </h4>
        <p class="body-copy">
            Once your tent is up, set up the inside of your tent. I like to do this straight away (there’s nothing worse than setting up a tent in the dark.)
        </p>
        <ul class="text-list">
            <li>Put down your sleeping pad (sleeping pad, foam, air mattress, yoga mat, cot), your sleeping bag, pillows, and sheets if applicable.</li>
            <li>Make sure your sleeping pad does not touch the edges of your tent since it can pick up condensation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading3">
            The Firepit
        </h3>
        <p class="body-copy">
            First, make sure that your firepit is well built. To help reduce the risk of forest fires, all fires must be contained within a well built firepit.<br><br>

            Clean out the firepit if there is anything in it. If the ground of the firepit is humid or wet from rain, add a layer of aluminium foil to the bottom of the firepit.<br><br>

            Be smart about storing wood. Firewood has to remain dry as possible. Place your wood in a bin, in the car, or separate it from the ground by wrapping it with  a tarp. This will prevent it from picking up humidity from early-morning condensation. You can also dry the wood by carefully placing it on a grill on top of the firepit as the heat helps the water evaporate.
        </p>

            Building a Campfire
        </h4>
        <p class="body-copy">
            The best way to learn how to build a fire is to watch someone else doing it. The videos below break it down!
        </p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qOc7A5rwzl4?si=0k-46rdAxaiXyTYP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gsLtoaK93R0?si=FXZJL-Jh1ujD0j-7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="body-copy">
            You’ll need LOTS of kindling (small sticks), tinder (paper and other flammable items) and wood for a fire. I recommend holding onto your discarded paper and cardboard for a month or so before going camping, and bringing it to burn in the fire.<br><br>

            Lots of people use firestarter, but you can make your own version by stuffing empty egg cartons with leftover dryer lint, then melting some wax and pouring it on top. It’s not only a great way to recycle, but it works much better than store bought firestarter, and it’s food safe!
