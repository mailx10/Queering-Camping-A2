                        Animals will try their very best to get into your food. This is the reality of camping - you’re on their turf, after all! If you’re camping in Canada, the usual suspects will be raccoons and squirrels, but in certain areas bears can also be an issue.<br><br>

                        With that in mind, always keep food locked away in bins and your cooler when you’re not cooking. Keep all food in a closing, locking container. No grocery bags just floating around! Raccoons in particular know how to open a bin, so make sure it’s secured.<br><br>

                        Leave the bins in the car overnight (and whenever you’re away from the campsite), lock them using locking carabiners, or keep your food locked bins provided by the campground. Keep all food bins away from your tent at all times.<br><br>

                        Do not bring any food or scented items into the tents. Never store food in your tent. No snacking in your tent. Ever! Food is eaten and stored AWAY from the tent. The main concern I hear from friends who are hesitant about camping is the fear of animals at night. If you don’t have food out, you have nothing to worry about.

                        Some areas have stricter regulations regarding food storage (ex. Bear country). Look up local food storage recommendations for the area you’ll be camping in. Some campgrounds offer food lockers.<br><br>

                        Trash also has scent to it. Try to limit the trash you produce, but inevitably, you will be producing some. Tie your trash bags up in a tree for short term use, then bring it to the campground’s trash bins every evening before sunset.<br><br>

                        Set up a clothesline to dry clothes as needed. You can just tie some rope around two trees to do so.<br><br>

                        Do not dispose of graywater or dishwater at your campsite, as it may leave food crumbs and smells  attracting wildlife. Make sure you dump dispose the water at a water station instead.

                        Once of the main concerns I hear from my friends re: camping is the fear of the dark, that someone or something will come into their tent in the middle of the night. There is a certain quietness in the woods that city folks are not used to. This quiet also means that you will inevitably notice every single noise you hear, which can understandably be spooky! It’s important to reassure yourself that there is most likely absolutely nothing to worry about. As people of marginalized genders, it is reasonable to have some concerns re: others, however, in general, camping is very safe. *Of course, listen to your intuition about other campers and the campground itself, and if you feel you need to leave due to your safety, always listen to your gut.

                        It’s normal to get scared at night, but camping can be an exercise in how to not let that fear control us. A great way to feel safer is to be prepared! Some tips:

                            <li>Don’t just rely on your phone as a flashlight. Bring a few lanterns / flashlights (with extra batteries!)</li>
                            <li>Stay in a group at all times.</li>
                            <li>Be aware of the animals in the area, and what they sound like. Unexplainable noises are much scarier than noises that can be identified.</li>
                            <li>Keep the number of the front desk / park ranger on hand in case of an emergency.</li>
                            <li>Keep your car keys close in case you need to get into the car. Sleep in the car if you’re feeling too exposed sleeping in the tent.</li>
                            <li>Talk or make noise when walking through a forested area at night. Animals in general will leave you alone if you are making noise.</li>
                            <li>Equip yourself with an alarm, whistle, and dog spray in case of an attack.</li>
                            <li>Sleep with a small weapon at your side (axe, spray, bat, etc). Even though you will most likely not need it, it can be comforting!</li>
                            <li>Do some positive self talk, reassure yourself and your friends that you will keep each other safe. If you feel mentally safe, you will feel better overall and get a better night sleep.</li>
                            <li>With experience and practice, this fear will lessen and you will become more comfortable handling this fear.</li>
